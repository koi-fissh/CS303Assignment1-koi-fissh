This program reads from the input.txt line by line and places the integers into an appropriately sized array.
EX: If there are 50 lines of integers, the program will input them into 50 indexes of an array.

It can also modify the array similar to a vector.

To use this program you can:
1. Modify the input.txt and add/remove integers line by line
2. Run the program and navigate using the menu displayed in the terminal by inputting an option which runs the appropriate function

"C - Check if an integer exist in the array"
"M - Modify a value of an integer on an index"
"A - Add a new integer to the end of the array"
"R - Remove an index of the array"
"P - Output the array"
"Q - Quit"
